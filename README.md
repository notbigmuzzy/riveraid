# River Rogue | Legacy Raid
   A ( rather simple ) tribute to River Raid (**== best game ever made ==**) using native web technologies I created for the #devember 2021 challenge

## Original game
   The original game was created in the 82/83 by [Carol Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Shaw), here's a great short documentary about the subject - [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OcT5zJzVV0) and is, incidentally, first video game I ever played, on an C64C which my parents bought in 1989.
